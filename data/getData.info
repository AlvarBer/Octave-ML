1. Introduction

The following points introduces the transformation that suffer the original DATA set to
obtain the X set in the function [X, Y] = getClassificationData (DATA)


2. Description of the X set
=====


## Price fields

X(:,1) - price_difference - difference in price of the stock in the current week

    Result of close (close: the price of the stock at the end of the
    week) - open (Price of the stock at the beginning of the week)


    Corresponds to data(:,7) - data(:,4)

X(:,2) - price_range - difference between the highest and the lowest price of
          the stock during the week

    Result of high (the highest price of the stock during the week) -
    low (the lowest price of the stock during the week)

    Corresponds to data(:,5) - data(:,6)

X(:,3) - percent_change_price: the percentage change in price throughout the week

    Corresponds to data(:,9)

## Volume fields

X(:,4) - volume: the number of shares of stock that traded hands in the week

    Corresponds to data(:,8)

X(:,5) - previous_week_volume: the number of shares of stock that traded hands
          in the previous week

    Corresponds to data(:,11)

X(:,6) - percent_change_volume_over_last_week: the percentage change in the number
          of shares of stock that traded hands for this week compared to the
          previous week

    Corresponds to data(:,10)


X(:,7) - days_to_next_dividend: the number of days until the next dividend

    Corresponds to data(:,15)

X(:,8) - percent_return_next_dividend: the percentage of return on the next
          dividend

    Corresponds to data(:,16)


2. Description of the Y set
=====

Y(:,1) - profitable
  (1 = Profitable;
   2 = Non-profitable)

   This field is extracted from percent_change_next_weeks_price (the percentage
   change in price of the stock in the following week)
   If the percentage is negative, the investment will not be profitable. Else,
   the investment will produce profit.
   Zero values are considered non-profitable.

   Corresponds to data(:,14)


3. Description of data that I didn't used
=====

quarter
  (1 = Jan-Mar;
   2 = Apr=Jun)

   I will take advantadge of these value to classify the data for training or
   validating. For this analysis I will train with the first quarter and
   validate with the second quarter

   Corresponds to data(:,1)

stock:
  As we don't have enough training examples to make a specific prediction for
  each stock (12 examples per quarter), we need to get rid of this field to
  make a general prediction based only on values without taking into account
  they belong to.

  Corresponds to data(:,2)

#Future values

We can't train our model using values that comes from the future taking into
consideration that we need to predict using values from the present. These
values are:

X(:,5) - next_week_price_difference: difference in price of the stock in the
          following week

    Result of next_weeks_close - next_weeks_open

    Corresponds to data(:,13) - data(:,12)
