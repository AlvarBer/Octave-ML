The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.\r\n\r\n##External references\r\nThe dataset used for this practice has been downloaded from the\r\n[UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)\r\ncorresponding to the **Bank Marketing Data Set**\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a paper that make reference to this data set:\r\n[S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing.
